Thread has been MODIFIED by Arachne Digital; it was originally created
by The MITRE Corporation as TRAM.

Thread USES a MODIFIED version of the library Newspaper3k.

We, Arachne Digital, release Thread under the same license of the original
version, that license being the APACHE LICENSE, VERSION 2.0.

In compliance with the license of TRAM, its original NOTICE has been included
below. This is followed by the original license of Newspaper3k to comply with
its license terms.

Thread also USES icons from Font Awesome. These are licensed under the Creative
Commons license (CC BY 4.0). Font Awesome states they handle sufficient
attribution within their files (a license condition of use). Nonetheless, we wish
to link to the license and state we have not made any modifications to the files:
