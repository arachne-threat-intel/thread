## What is an Open Canvas?
Open Canvas is a strategic planning tool designed to refine and crystallise project ideas, particularly in community-driven and collaborative contexts. Adapted from the Lean Canvas, a format commonly used for startup business projects, Open Canvas is uniquely tailored for projects driven by community participation and volunteer contributions, aligning with the core principles of working open.

An Open Canvas is a one-page template with essential project details, considering both a project's product aspects and its community dynamics. This tool serves as a bridge between a project vision and a concrete plan, fostering clarity and resource alignment.

The Open Canvas concept was developed by [Abby Cabunoc Mayes](https://github.com/abbycabs) as part of the [Mozilla Open Leaders Programme](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/)

You can see the Open Canvas templates [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9UZnVcaoMU6Mmtwc3dzOVQ4LW8/view?resourcekey=0-sPUfyGywW059_G-AyD0_-w) and [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_eya6vVXpaZOpXFZsZNbVHboROI4IPWy-poCnYTNtnQ/edit#slide=id.g1b30ce0bb1_0_90).

## Problem
- Sections: Product

The top three problems Thread is trying to solve.

1. Efficient cyber threat intelligence (CTI) mapping: Traditional threat intelligence mapping is labour-intensive and time-consuming, requiring cybersecurity analysts to manually identify tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in reports and articles. This inefficiency can lead to delays in threat detection and response.
2. Empowering informed cybersecurity defences: Many existing threat intelligence feeds lack transparency and provide data that may be inaccurate or outdated. This poses a challenge for security professionals who rely on this information to fortify their cybersecurity defences.
3. Fostering collaborative open source cybersecurity: The cybersecurity community benefits from open source tools and knowledge sharing. However, the lack of accessible, open-source threat intelligence tools can hinder collaboration among security analysts and researchers.

## Solution
- Sections: Product

The proposed solutions to the above problems.

1. Efficient CTI mapping: Thread streamlines the mapping process, automating the identification of TTPs in cybersecurity reports and articles. By leveraging machine learning, Thread accelerates this task, enabling analysts to swiftly pinpoint TTPs mentioned in threat intelligence sources, thereby expediting threat detection and response.
2. Empowering informed cybersecurity defences: Thread empowers security professionals by allowing them to conduct their own research and access up-to-date, actionable threat data. This self-reliance ensures that cybersecurity defences are built on accurate, real-time insights, addressing the limitations of opaque and potentially unreliable threat intelligence sources.
3. Fostering collaborative open source cybersecurity: Thread actively promotes open source cybersecurity research and collaboration. As a free, open-source tool, it encourages security experts to work together, refine threat intelligence, and enhance the collective security landscape. Thread's commitment to citing original sources and facilitating knowledge sharing supports a thriving community dedicated to strengthening defences against evolving cyber threats.
