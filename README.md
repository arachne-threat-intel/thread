## Thread in Simple Terms
Thread is a tool for analysts to map finished reports and articles about cyber attacks to [MITRE ATT&CK<sup>®</sup>](https://attack.mitre.org).

Thread was originally forked from TRAM when it was in its beta phase, and we wanted to build upon it. Therefore, further changes to the original TRAM repo may not be incorporated into Thread as the codebases have largely diverged. 

## Why Thread?
Thread is not just another cybersecurity tool; it redefines how we approach CTI mapping. We have distilled the essence of Thread's unique value proposition into an experience that is efficient, empowering, and community-driven.

Efficiency Unleashed: Bid farewell to tedious, manual processes of mapping reports to MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that consume hours of your valuable time. Thread's intelligent algorithms work tirelessly to automate the mapping of TTPs. What used to be a painstaking endeavour now takes mere minutes. With Thread, you will liberate yourself from data wrangling and reclaim your focus for strategic insights.

Empowerment in Your Hands: Thread is all about putting the power of threat intelligence back where it belongs – in your hands. Take control of your security posture by refining and verifying threat data. Our platform ensures that your decisions are based on data that you know is relevant to you. Say goodbye to relying on outdated or inaccurate information; with Thread, you are in control.

Community Collaboration: Thread is being built into an open-source community committed to advancing the field of CTI. By choosing Thread, you become part of a network of cybersecurity experts who share your passion for creating a safer digital world. Together, we forge a path towards a future where CTI is agile, collaborative, and precise.

## Website
If you want to use Thread right now, feel free to use the web version at https://app.arachne.digital/thread.

## Requirements
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (3.8+)
  - In line with Python 3.8 EOL being scheduled in October 2024, we will remove support for Python 3.8 soon.

## Installation
We recommend using a virtual environment for installing Python package dependencies.

Please note: if your environment has multiple Python interpreters (e.g. `python` is for Python 2.x/3.x and `python3` is for Python 3.y, please adjust some of the commands below accordingly. For example, `pip` may be `python3 -m pip install ...` and `python main.py` may be `python3 main.py`).

- Start by cloning this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/arachne-threat-intel/thread.git
```

-  Install our submodule dependencies. Steps are listed [here](documentation/submodules.md).


- Before installing the required Python packages, consider which database you would like to use.
  - For a simpler setup, you can skip this step for now.
  - To read about our database options, see our documentation [here](documentation/database.md).


- From the root of this project, install the Python package requirements.**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Revisit the database docs (stated earlier) to set up the database before running Thread for the first time.


- Then start the application.
  - When you launch this for the first time, this will take some time to sync with MITRE ATT&CK data.

```
python main.py
```

Once the server has started, point your browser to localhost:9999, and you can then enter a URL on the home page.
It currently takes several minutes to analyse a report, so please do not leave the page while it processes.

Configuration defaults can be changed [here](threadcomponents/conf/config.yml).

---

You are also welcome to check our test-suite via:
```
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

In the same directory, you may also run our lint tests. You need to install Ruff (via `pip install ruff`; more info [here](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/installation/)). You can then do the following command:

```
ruff check .
```

We use `ruff` to format our code. You can do this by running the following command:

```
ruff format
```

** For package maintenance, you may find the command below useful. Please be warned this has risks such as code-breakages from an upgraded package version where this command upgraded multiple packages at once causing debugging to be difficult.

```
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Submitting a report
On Thread's homepage, enter a web page URL (sorry no PDFs yet) to process it and begin a report based on it. It takes a few minutes to analyse a URL, this is dependent on the amount of text found from the URL. You are advised to periodically check if your submission is still in the queue.

If you see an error in the queue, this means the website did not like us trying to fetch its contents, or something on the site could not be parsed. We will periodically check for these errors and work on improvements to the submission process.

When the URL has been processed and its report is ready, a new card will appear (in the **Needs Review** column). Each card will have two buttons:
- **Source**: this links back to original URL where the report originated from
- **Analyse**: this button links to the Thread-analysed report

You will also have the option to delete reports that 1. are not in the queue or 2. those in the queue that have an error.

## Shared vs. local
You can use Thread via https://app.arachne.digital/thread.

If you use Thread via our Arachne website, your reports will be visible to others and accessible by the Arachne team. To reduce its visibility, you can flag reports as private on report-submission (please note, these reports will still be accessible by the Arachne team); you will need to sign up for an account on the Arachne website and remain logged-in during report-submission.

Alternatively, you can clone this repo, set it up, and use it locally to ensure all your reports stay only on your machine.

## Analysing a report
Thread's prediction model will try its best to find ATT&CK techniques in the report, but since our current data set is very limited, our models are not 100% accurate, so the tool requires you to review and refine the technique prediction.

When you click on a sentence in the report, you can do the following:
- **Accept** a technique: the correct technique is in the selected sentence. That sentence and technique will be considered a **true positive** (if this is not a missing technique you have introduced).
- **Reject** a technique: the technique is not in the selected sentence. That sentence and technique will be considered a **false positive** (again, if this is not a missing technique you have introduced).
- **Add a Missing Technique**: allows you to manually add any techniques that were missed in the selected sentence. Select the missing technique from the provided searchable-dropdown. You can repeat this for numerous missing techniques. When one is added, this is considered a **false negative** (if this is not a technique you initially rejected).

As more data is fed to the tool and is reviewed, any rebuilt models are expected to become more accurate with these predictions.

If you have made changes you are not happy with and cannot undo them easily (e.g., deleted a sentence), you can rollback a report via the homepage (found in the **In Review** column).

## Exporting a report
Once you have reviewed the entire report, Thread’s results can be exported as a PDF by clicking the **Export PDF** button on the top centre of the page. This will create a PDF containing a raw text version of the report, and a table with the ATT&CK technique and its corresponding sentence. This can be done for all reports out of the queue but those not in the **Completed** column will be considered draft reports.

## Understanding MITRE ATT&CK, TTPs and how to leverage them
We have mentioned MITRE ATT&CK, TTPs and CTI mapping a great deal, but why are these things even relevant to cybersecurity? What does CTI mapping yield?

### MITRE ATT&CK®:
[MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a comprehensive knowledge base used globally in the cybersecurity community. It provides a structured framework to understand the TTPs employed by cyber threat actors (CTAs).

### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):
TTPs are the building blocks of threat intelligence. Here is what you need to know about them:

- Tactics: These represent the high-level objectives that threat actors aim to achieve during an attack. Examples include initial access, execution, persistence, and exfiltration.
- Techniques: Techniques are the specific methods or mechanisms used by threat actors to accomplish tactical goals. For instance, a technique under the "Initial Access" tactic might be "Phishing."
- Procedures: Procedures are the detailed steps or sequences of actions that threat actors follow when executing a technique. They offer a granular view of how an attack is carried out.

### The Role of TTPs:
TTPs are like the DNA of cyber threats. By identifying and understanding them, you gain insight into the methods employed by threat actors. This knowledge is invaluable for enhancing your security posture.

- Linking TTPs to security controls: TTPs are not abstract concepts; they have real-world implications for your security infrastructure. MITRE ATT&CK empowers you to link TTPs to specific security controls. These controls are measures, safeguards, or countermeasures designed to mitigate or counteract the associated threats.
- Connecting TTPs to Event IDs in logs: In the world of security operations, event logs are the treasure trove of information. MITRE ATT&CK assists you in linking TTPs to event IDs within these logs. This connection is vital for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solutions. It allows you to create rules and detections based on specific TTPs.
- Harnessing TTPs for targeted protection: Ultimately, MITRE ATT&CK empowers you to tailor your cybersecurity defences to your unique circumstances. If you know which threat groups are targeting your industry in your part of the world, you can align TTPs with the most relevant security controls and event IDs in your logs. This precision enhances your ability to detect and respond to threats effectively.

To give you a primer in these concepts, or if videos are just more your thing, check out [Putting MITRE ATT&CK™ into Action with What You Have, Where You Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkfwMADar0M), an amazing presentation by Katie Nickels.
