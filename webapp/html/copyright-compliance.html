    Using Thread involves submitting website links for analysis. Arachne Digital has to comply with a website's Terms

    security research and ultimately impedes people trying to protect themselves and their organisations.

      As you are using Thread locally - independent of Arachne Digital's servers - we have not restricted which websites
      you can submit to create a report. However, we do advise you before making submissions to <b>check the Terms of
      Use of websites you are going to submit</b> to this local version of Thread.

      You may have encountered website URLs which we have prevented you from submitting to Thread to comply with that
      website's copyright. If you want the ability to analyse pages from such websites with Thread, please copy and

      consent to Thread scraping their site, we'll lift the block.

      Dear &lt;name&gt;,
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm trying to use a tool called Thread (https://www.arachne.digital/thread) to analyse information on your website
      against MITRE ATT&CKÂ®, however your Terms of Use state that your site - &lt;URL blocked by Thread&gt; - cannot be
      scraped. I ask that you please grant an exception to Thread for the purposes of research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thread is a free open source tool built by Arachne Digital to support security professionals. Arachne Digital
      does aggregate the analysis and offers a paid threat intelligence feed separate from Thread, but no scraped
      information appears in the separate paid threat intelligence feed. Your information is not sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thread scrapes information from websites and outputs a PDF file that lists all the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and
      procedures) found in the free text on that site. Thread appropriately cites where the information came from and
      does not reproduce the text from the site other than single sentences against each TTP found, to reference where
      that TTP was found. Feel free to try out Thread for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you allow Thread to scrape your site, you'll be supporting security research and promoting the useful content
      on your site, since documents produced by Thread cite the original source. You may even have cyber threat analysts
      on staff that find Thread useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please email Arachne Digital on contact[at]arachne[dot]digital if you consent to Thread scraping your website.
    </p>
