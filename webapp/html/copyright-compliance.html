    Using Thread involves submitting website links for analysis. Arachne Digital has to comply with a website's Terms
    of Use. Whilst we respect article authors and website owners wanting to protect their work, this restriction slows
    security research and ultimately impedes people trying to protect themselves and their organisations.

  <p>
    If you want the ability to analyse pages from such websites with Thread, please copy and paste the below text into
    an email and send it to the website owner. Should the website owner contact us and consent to Thread scraping their
    site, we'll lift the block.

    Dear &lt;name&gt;,
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm trying to use a tool called Thread (https://www.arachne.digital/thread) to analyse information on your website
    against MITRE ATT&CKÂ®, however your Terms of Use state that your site - &lt;URL blocked by Thread&gt; - cannot be
    scraped. I ask that you please grant an exception to Thread for the purposes of research.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thread is a free open source tool built by Arachne Digital to support security professionals. Arachne Digital
    does aggregate the analysis and offers a paid threat intelligence feed separate from Thread, but no scraped
    information appears in the separate paid threat intelligence feed. Your information is not sold.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thread scrapes information from websites and outputs a PDF file that lists all the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and
    procedures) found in the free text on that site. Thread appropriately cites where the information came from and
    does not reproduce the text from the site other than single sentences against each TTP found, to reference where
    that TTP was found. Feel free to try out Thread for yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you allow Thread to scrape your site, you'll be supporting security research and promoting the useful content
    on your site, since documents produced by Thread cite the original source. You may even have cyber threat analysts
    on staff that find Thread useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please email Arachne Digital on contact[at]arachne[dot]digital if you consent to Thread scraping your website.

    If you do not want your website to be scraped, please contact us (via the details from our
    <a href="{{about_url}}">About</a> page) with the URL of your website (or the URL of your website's Terms of Use).
